# sqlalchemy-challenge

Background / Overview:
	I decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. BUT! I can't just go on a vacation without doing a detailed climate analysis about the area - after all, how can one just - luxuriate - without knowing what to pack, whether or not it will rain, if flannel pajamas will have to make an appearance etc.

Objective:
	Use Python & SQLAlchemy to do a rudimentary climate analysis - focusing on precipitation.
